                <p style="font-size:30px;">Engineer | Singer | Sportswoman</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"> I am passionate about Science and Music and hope to pursue a career in both these streams. My fascination for Science
                    started right from my childhool, thanks to my grandfather, who himself is an incredible engineer and has been my primary inspiration.
                    As a hyper-active kid, I used to be very mischievious and that energy had to be channeled into a useful and productive form. This
                    led to me being enrolled in carnatic music. I also enjoyed playing badminton and cycling. I aspire to become a great engineer and a musician
                    and I intend to become a teacher of arts and science after 10-15 years.
