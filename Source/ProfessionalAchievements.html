         <h3>O.R.G.A.N.</h3>
         <p> Optimised Recognition of gestures Aided by Neural Newtwork (O.R.G.A.N) 
            is a Machine Learning based project aimed at recognising basic hand gestures and enabling cursor control  
            through gestures. The project was published on <b>International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology 
            (IRJET).</b>

         <h3>R.A.T.S.</h3>
         <p> 
            Real-time Adaptive Traffic System (R.A.T.S) aimed at enabling faster decongestion 
            of road traffic by taking traffic severity from Bing Maps into account. The traffic signal timeframes are distributed 
            proportionally so that no lane with less traffic gets more Green time and no road with more traffic gets less Green time. 
            The paper was published in <b>International Journal of Engineering and Technology (IJET).</b>
